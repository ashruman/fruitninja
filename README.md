# Fruit Ninja (Arduino)
This repository is to back up the Arduino code used for my Fruit Ninja project. I used [p5.serialcontrol](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases/tag/0.1.2) to send input from Arduino to p5.js.
The p5.js sketch for the project can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/ashr/sketches/xyXM1rcK9).
